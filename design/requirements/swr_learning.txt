Software shall offer an interface through which new information is
passed. Software shall evaluate the input and do appropiate changes
(described later) to the database [1] according to passed information.

The interface shall support these functions:
    - add an object
    - associate an object with a property
    - associate an object with a generalization

When adding an object the interface shall accept one argument: the name
of the object.

//The interface returns a pair: first is a list of
//generalizations found for the object name. second is a callable that
//takes one generalization as an argument, adds the object and associates
//it with the generalization.


When passed a new property association the learning interface shall
accept two arguments: name of the object and name of the property. The
software shall associate the object with the property in the database:
    These actions are performed in a separate thread:
        - If the object doesn't exist it is inserted into the 'objects'
          table.
        - If the property doesn't exist it is inserted into the
          'objects' table.
